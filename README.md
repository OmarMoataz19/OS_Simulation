# Simple OS Simulation

## Overview

This repository contains a simple operating system simulation designed to illustrate key concepts such as mutex, scheduler, interpreter, parser, and system calls. The simulation is written in Java, and it serves as an educational tool for understanding the fundamental components of an operating system.

## Features

1. **Mutex Implementation**: Explore a basic implementation of mutexes to demonstrate synchronization and mutual exclusion in a multi-threaded environment.

2. **Scheduler**: Learn about process scheduling with a simple scheduler that manages the execution of multiple tasks.

3. **Interpreter and Parser**: Gain insights into how an operating system interprets and parses commands. The interpreter allows users to interact with the simulated OS through a command-line interface.

4. **System Calls**: Understand the concept of system calls and how they facilitate communication between user programs and the operating system kernel.
